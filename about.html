<!--Body-->
<p>My name is Jonathan Rupert and I am an avid enjoyer of road tripping, but also love to explore where you can go beyond the road you drive. My profession is physics. 
I have degrees in both physics and astronomy from The University of Texas at Austin and work in a nuclear science facility. Beyond employment, I enjoy exploring the outdoors 
and thinking about how nature, history, science, and road travel all intersect. The United States is a perfect place for this, all of those things are immediately around us and underneath our feet 
(whether we realize it or not). I aim to write about these topics and how this intersection is a vital part of where we call home. Hopefully you learn something new as I add more things
to this website.</p>
<p>If I make any mistakes, or if you have any comments or questions, feel free to contact me! My email is jonathan (dot) rupert (at) outlook (dot) com! I'd love to hear what you have to say 
about any of the topics I have mentioned above.</p>
