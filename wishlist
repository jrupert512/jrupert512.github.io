Congrats! :D
If you found this, it means you located where I keep track of the things I want to add to my website.
wishlist of items to add to the website:
once I have enough posts- a hyperlink at the top to a random blog post?
Fun photos!
Guestbook and viewer counter
The first story! (John Wesley Powell at Shiloh -- hopefully) <- INCLUDE PUBLISHING DATE WITH BLOG POSTS!!!
Definitely easter eggs within the website somehow that can be kid of surreal/nostalgiac/unhinged or pages that are like a Geocities website. But they have to be deep within, and take
some effort to find. Maybe that should be a theme on the website. Normal from the home and front pages, but gets crazier the further you go. I want it to be a bottomless pit.

In fact, there should be a super secret link in this file itself that goes to a complex url on the website which has some form of easter egg. I'll have to think about it.
