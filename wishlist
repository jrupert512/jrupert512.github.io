Congrats! :D
If you found this, it means you located where I keep track of the things I want to add to my website.
wishlist of items to add to the website:
once I have enough posts- a hyperlink at the top to a random blog post?
Fun photos!
Guestbook and viewer counter
The first story! (John Wesley Powell at Shiloh -- hopefully) <- INCLUDE PUBLISHING DATE WITH BLOG POSTS!!!
A page reflecting on Moby-Dick. Inherently incomplete, page styled like the ocean. Pull a few passages that resonate and reflect upon what the book meant to you.
- The cetology sections being the most important part, and the narrative just serving as a way to explore that.
Perhaps nothing can fully explain whales, and you will be driven mad to try and fully understand anything, as we are individuals that can only experience ourselves.
Definitely easter eggs within the website somehow that can be kid of surreal/nostalgiac/unhinged or pages that are like a Geocities website. But they have to be deep within, and take
some effort to find. Maybe that should be a theme on the website. Normal from the home and front pages, but gets crazier the further you go. I want it to be a bottomless pit.

In fact, there should be a super secret link in this file itself that goes to a complex url on the website which has some form of easter egg. I'll have to think about it.
